This car can have many features, such as color, model name, year built, # of seats, etc. If we were to translate this into OOP, the object in question would be the car and those previously listed features would be attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "To create a car object, we need to use a class for it. Think of classes like blueprints or a shell. The car object is simply a class/blueprint to build cars. Let's build this class."

        "Encapsulation is the process of wrapping up variables and methods into a single entity. When your code is encapsulated, it is protected against outside effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class. A parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class. Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class. \n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism means the same function name is used for different types. Basically, polymorphism lets us define methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Don't worry if these definitions confused you! Parent and child classes can get confusing, and its okay if you do not understand how they work. we can't go over everything in this lesson, but feel free to learn more about the 4 pillars on your own time."
