In the AI & Machine Learning club, we will be using Python to code our projects! \n","\n","In this series of lessons, we will walk you through fundamental Python knowledge that will assist you with your projects. Keep in mind that this is a very condensed course, so it would be very important for you to practice and review this on your own as well. If you have any questions, try figuring it out on your own at first! Some great resources are StackOverflow, MDM, YouTube, and W3Schools. If the answer isn't online, ask a peer! Then, feel free to ask a leader or a teacher as a last resort.\n","\n","Note: This tutorial is for beginners or people who need a recap of Python.

Python doesn't require a complex understanding of computers to use it. A low-level language is more \"machine friendly\" rather than \"people friendly.\" An example of this is the C programming language.\n","\n","2) **Interpreted** means that to develop a Python program, you write the code in a file known as source code. To execute/run this code, it needs to be converted into machine language that the computer understands. When a Python file is executed, the Python interpreter turns the source code into machine code, line by line. The opposite of this is a compiled language, like Java. This means they use a compiler that compiles the source code *before* the program is executed.\n","\n","3) **General-purpose** means that Python can be used in a variety of domains, such as websites, apps, data science, software, and machine learning. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"86aJNnylvJa2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## A Note on Syntax Before We Get Started\n","\n","Python uses whitespace as a way to seperate code.
